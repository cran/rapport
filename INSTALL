Installing a backend
====================

As the main purpose of `rapport` is to export the template-based reports to nicely formatted
documents - it is highly recommended to install a backend for that.

Based on `ascii` (URL: http://eusebe.github.com/ascii/), the following engines are supported:
 * a2x          http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/a2x.1.html
 * asciidoc     http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/
 * markdown2pdf http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#markdown2pdf
 * pandoc       http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
 * txt2tags     http://txt2tags.org/
 
In order to export templates to our factory default HTML design (http://rapport-package.info), 
install pandoc from http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html and use default settings.

We recommend using the development version of pandoc which even supports docx output:

Development version
===================

Besides CRAN release you can grab the latest build from GitHub:
    https://github.com/aL3xa/rapport/

That nifty function of `devtools` package might speed up installing dev version:

    library(devtools)
    install_github('rapport', 'aL3xa')

Or you can also download sources in a zip and build the package manually:
    https://github.com/aL3xa/rapport/zipball/master

To do so, please extract archive to an empty directory and run the following commands on a unix-like system:

    R CMD build rapport
    R CMD INSTALL <path to .tar.gz file>

If you're running R on Windows, you need to install Rtools:
    http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/windows/Rtools/

Once you have installed it, and issue following commands in command prompt:

    R CMD build --binary <path to .tar.gz file>
    R CMD INSTALL <path to .zip file>
