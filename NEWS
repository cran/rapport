CHANGES

  * removed `ascii` and `evaluate` packages and introduced `pander`

    This was a quite big change in the backend which resulted in some removed functions of prior version.

    `panderOptions()` and `evalsOptions()` from `pander` package.

  * the repository was moved to Rapporter's organisation GH account from @aL3xa
