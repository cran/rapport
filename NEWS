rapport 0.3 (2012-02-07)
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Introduced own `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` functions to get rid of 'moments' dependency.
* Option (default set to FALSE) to view generated plots without exporting (`replayPlot`)
* Same option let users resize generated (and saved) images on the fly while printing rapport classes
  and later exporting   

CHANGES

* Removed `moments` and `latticeExtra` from package dependencies.
* Updated demo
* `rapport()` will now check for packages specified in the template header and throw error if
  something goes wrong while loading.
* `tpl.example` now uses `readlines` instead of reading from `stdin` (Windows and Eclipse/StatET bug)
* `tpl.export` now checks if specified backend is installed and throws an error if not.
* Checking if a plot was generated in `evals` is done with the help of `replayPlot` instead of
  file size checks (for OS independence).


BUGFIXES

* Windows path issue
* Windows default grDevice bug with checking if a plot was generated (by checking file size changes)
* Formatting issues with non-pandoc backends
