# Introduction

In a nutshell, the [one-sample t-test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#One-sample_t-test) is a statistical test, that assesses the hypothesis of equality of a variable's mean and a specified value.

# Overview

In this case _one-sample t-test_ is carried out comparing the mean of the <%= x.label %> variable, to a specified value of _<%= mu %>_. Confidence interval is set to <%= pct(ci.level * 100, 0) %>.

# Descriptives

In order to get more insight on the underlying data, a table of basic descriptive statistics is displayed below.

<%=
rp.desc(x, NULL, c(min, max, mean, sd, var, median, IQR, skewness, kurtosis), rapport.data)
%>

# Diagnostics

Since _t-test_ is a parametric technique, it sets some basic assumptions on distribution shape: it has to be _normal_ (or approximately normal). A few normality test are to be applied, in order to screen possible departures from normality.

## Normality Tests

We will use _Shapiro-Wilk_, _Lilliefors_ and _Anderson-Darling_ tests to screen departures from normality in the (<%= x.label %>) variable.

<%=
if (length(x)>5000) {
  ntest <- htest(sample(x, 5000), shapiro.test)
  ntest <- rbind(ntest, htest(x, lillie.test, ad.test))
} else {
  ntest <- htest(x, shapiro.test, lillie.test, ad.test)
}
ntest
%>

As you can see, based on the [p-values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), applied tests <%= ifelse(all(ntest$p < .05), "confirm departures from normality", "yield different results on hypotheses of normality, so you may want to stick with one you find most appropriate or you trust the most") %>.<%= ifelse(length(x)>5000, " Please note: The Shapiro-Wilk test was only run on a sample (N=5000) of the data.", "") %>


# Results

<%=
with(tt, data.frame(statistic, df = parameter, p = p.value, `CI(lower)` = conf.int[1], `CI(upper)` = conf.int[2], check.names = FALSE))
%> 

<%= tt$method %> was applied and, based on the p-value, significant differences <%= ifelse(tt$p.value < 1 - ci.level, "were", "weren't") %> found.
